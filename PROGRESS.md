- AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)
- Runnable runbooks
- On-call simulation exercises
- Backup/restore and DR testing

### Week 1 — Incident Response Playbook
- [x] Created month-6-incident-chaos-engineering/week-1 — copied Week 4 infra files as baseline
- [x] Cut month-6-week-1 branch
- [x] Built references/incident-response-playbook.md — full Northwind playbook

- [x] Wrote alarm-specific first-response checklists for all 5 alarms
- [x] Wrote communication templates: initial notification, status update, resolution
- [x] Learned: playbook vs runbook distinction, severity classification, incident lifecycle

### Week 2 — AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)
- [x] Added ecs_cluster_arn output to compute module — required for FIS target resolution
- [x] Added burn_rate_alarm_arn output to observability module — used as FIS stop condition
- [x] Added comments to observability outputs.tf — consistent with compute module style
- [x] Built FIS IAM role and policy — scoped to StopTask, DescribeTasks, DescribeAlarms
- [x] Built FIS experiment template — targets ECS tasks by Project tag, COUNT(1) and COUNT(2)
- [x] Added propagate_tags = "SERVICE" to ECS service — tasks inherit service tags for FIS targeting
- [x] Ran single task stop experiment — ECS self-healed in under 60 seconds, no alarms fired
- [x] Ran dual task stop experiment — ECS self-healed faster than alarm evaluation windows
- [x] Learned: ECS Fargate self-healing is faster than alarm thresholds — resilience is good but makes chaos testing harder
- [x] Built broken v9 image — nginx passes ELB health checks but returns 500 to real traffic
- [x] Deployed v9 via CodeDeploy — canary and 5xx alarms fired as expected
- [x] Rolled back to v8 via CodeDeploy — all alarms cleared, system recovered
- [x] Learned: auto-rollback only catches deployment failures, not post-deployment application failures
- [x] Learned: chaos via bad deployment is more reliable than FIS task-stop for fast-recovering Fargate services

### Week 3 — Runnable Runbooks

- [x] Built investigate-canary.sh — alarm state, direct curl test, ECS health, S3 FAILED grep command
- [x] Learned: runnable vs documentary runbooks, scripts complement not replace the First Responder Checklist, variables resolve at print time for copy-paste readiness, -z flag for empty string checks, FAILED grep pattern for S3 canary artifacts
