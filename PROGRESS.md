## Month 3 — Infrastructure as Code
Week 1 — Remote state + rebuild infra
Week 2 — Terraform modules + workspaces
Week 3 — CloudFormation
Week 4 — SSM at scale + Tagging strategies

### Week 1 — Remote State + Infrastructure Rebuild
- [x] Created S3 bucket for Terraform remote state with versioning and public access blocked
- [x] Created DynamoDB table for state locking
- [x] Consolidated Month 2 week-2 and week-3 configs into a single Terraform root
- [x] Wired S3 backend — state lives at month-3/week-1/terraform.tfstate
- [x] Rebuilt full infrastructure: VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway, EC2, SSM, CloudWatch, SNS
- [x] Verified nginx serving HTTP 200 via SSM session
- [x] Verified SSM agent and CloudWatch agent installed via user_data
- [x] Centralized Month 1 bash scripts into repo-level scripts/ directory
- [x] Wrote full repo README.md with month summaries and key decisions
- [x] Learned: remote state, state locking, bootstrap problem, consolidated roots

### Week 2 — Terraform Modules + Workspaces
- [x] Refactored flat main.tf into three reusable modules: networking, compute, observability
- [x] Each module has its own variables.tf, main.tf, and outputs.tf
- [x] Wired module outputs to module inputs via root main.tf
- [x] Verified data flow: networking → compute → observability
- [x] Ran terraform init, plan, and apply with modular structure
- [x] Verified nginx HTTP 200 via SSM on modular stack
- [x] Created dev, prod, and default workspaces
- [x] Made code workspace-aware: prod gets t3.small/30d logs, dev gets t2.micro/7d logs
- [x] Verified ternary expressions drive correct values per workspace
- [x] Learned: modules, data flow between modules, workspaces, ternary expressions

### Week 3 — CloudFormation
- [x] Learned CloudFormation vocabulary: stacks, parameters, resources, outputs
- [x] Mapped CloudFormation concepts to Terraform equivalents
- [x] Learned CloudFormation intrinsic functions: !Sub, !Ref
- [x] Built a CloudFormation template with SNS topic, email subscription, and CloudWatch alarms
- [x] Deployed stack with aws cloudformation deploy
- [x] Updated stack by adding a second alarm — CloudFormation diffed and added only the new resource
- [x] Deleted stack with aws cloudformation delete-stack
- [x] Verified stack resources and outputs with describe-stacks and list-stack-resources
- [x] Enabled AWS CLI auto-complete in WSL
- [x] Learned: CloudFormation vs Terraform tradeoffs, when each is used in production

### Week 4 — SSM at Scale + Tagging Strategies
- [x] Built SSM Document — SRELab-HealthCheck with 4 steps: service, disk, memory, failed services
- [x] Registered document with AWS via aws ssm create-document
- [x] Ran document against EC2 instance via aws ssm send-command
- [x] Verified health check output — nginx running, disk 24%, memory healthy, no failed services
- [x] Demonstrated SSM fleet targeting by tag in AWS Console
- [x] Defined six-tag schema: Name, Project, Environment, Owner, ManagedBy, CostCenter
- [x] Built tagging-strategy.md documenting the schema and rationale
- [x] Added locals block to all three modules with merge pattern
- [x] Applied tags to all 17 resources via terraform apply
- [x] Verified Environment tag enables SSM fleet targeting — 1 target, 1 completed, 0 errors
- [x] Learned: SSM Documents vs interactive sessions, tag-based targeting, merge pattern in Terraform
  [x] Enhanced SRELab-HealthCheck SSM document — added TOP CPU CONSUMERS step (ps aux sorted by CPU)
