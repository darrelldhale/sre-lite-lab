## Month 1 — SRE Foundations ⬅️ IN PROGRESS

### Week 1 — Linux Internals (In Progress)
- [x] Processes, PIDs, parent/child relationships
- [x] Signals and how the kernel communicates with processes
- [x] File descriptors and why everything is a file
- [x] systemd: units, targets, journald
- [x] cgroups: resource limits and container foundations

### Week 2 — Bash Scripting ✅
- [x] Variables, conditionals, loops, functions
- [x] Error handling: set -euo pipefail, exit codes, || true
- [x] Argument validation: $#, $1, $2, default values
- [x] Arrays and for loops
- [x] Built sre-snapshot.sh — full system state capture
- [x] Built sre-healthcheck.sh — 5-layer pass/fail health report
- [x] Built sre-watchdog.sh — auto-restart with logging and max retries
- [x] Built sre-logdig.sh — multi-source log search with time filtering

### Week 3 — Networking Fundamentals (Planned)
- [x] TCP/IP: how packets actually move
- [x] DNS: resolution from stub to root
- [x] HTTP: requests, responses, status codes
- [x] TLS: handshake, certificates, trust chains
- [x] Debugging tools: curl, dig, netstat, tcpdump

### Week 4 — Git Workflows + AWS CLI + IAM ✅
- [x] Git branching: checkout -b, merge, fast-forward vs merge commit
- [x] Branch cleanup and push workflow
- [x] AWS CLI output formats: json, table, text
- [x] JMESPath filtering with --query
- [x] IAM users, groups, policies, roles
- [x] AdministratorAccess policy — what it means
- [x] Service-linked roles — what they are and where they come from
- [x] Least privilege principle
